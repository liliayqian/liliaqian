Up until the summer before high school started, Mandy and I lived in the same neighborhood. We lived in the same kind of house, the townhouse that everyone else in the neighborhood had. I don’t remember not knowing Mandy. We were born the same year, the year of the snake. We went to all the same schools, our families were close, our older sisters were friends. 

When we were small, we did all the things that best friends were supposed to do—at least, according to the Disney channel. We made mud pies, a telephone out of two cups and a piece of string, and chalk drawings on the sidewalk. It wasn’t nearly as cool as we wanted it to be. Her parents got mad at us for ruining the nice Tupperware with our pies, our telephone was taken down as trash after we left it in our “treehouse” for a day, and we always had to hose the chalk off the sidewalk before her parents got home from work.

Mandy and I always tried to start traditions. We had lots of one-time-only traditions. If we ate apple pie on May seventh, it became Apple Pie Day. But then by the time the next May seventh rolled around, we had replaced Apple Pie Day with a new tradition. Summertime was prime time for making traditions.

## In the Trees

We each arrived at the foot of the tree with a sweaty armful of paperbacks. The pages wrinkled in the humid air. The afternoon was lethargic, well-settled into the thick heat and the evaporating remains of a late summer rain. We had to squint as we looked up; waves of unbearable heat made everything look fuzzy around the edges. The backs of our legs burned and salty droplets rolled down our temples, pooling into the dip of our collar bones and then soaking into our T-shirts. 

The tree was young and green, with none of the thick, well-seasoned bark you want in a good climbing tree. Its supple branches arched under our weight. Shiny, red-hot blisters broke the surface of our already-calloused hands as we struggled up, one at a time. Mandy went first, with an arm and an arm and a then a foot that propelled her into the green. Wiping her palms on her pants, Mandy crouched on her heels and leaned down for the books. She carefully stacked them on a branch as I passed them up to her, slowly. Our fingers stuck to the book covers like plastic cling wrap. 

Once all the books were in the tree, it was my turn. My pink rubber soles had long been worn flat and smooth, and they slipped down the sides of the narrow trunk. The entire tree leaned as I hooked a leg on a scratchy branch. By the time I settled in, most of our books had fallen headfirst into the dark, damp mulch mound below. We left them alone. 

Sitting in the tree wasn’t as comfortable as either of us had imagined. It was too sticky, too hot, and it left us with a mysterious itch all over our bodies. The hazy afternoon passed as we pretended to pore through what was left of our reading selection. 

When we started to feel a chill in our sweat-dampened clothes and the sky tinted blue, we slid down, hit the ground, and collected our books. Just as we each set out for home in opposite directions, we said our goodbyes and promised to meet again the next day, same time, same place.

## The Stream

On a January morning many years ago, Mandy called me on the phone to tell me that we were going to draw in the forest. Near my old house, there is a forest that runs for a few miles. In the forest, there is a narrow, man-made stream that runs under the roadway and opens into a man-made pond. In the winter, the surface of the stream freezes and the man-made waterfall at its center stops flowing and freezes into spiky rows of comb-shaped icicles. 

We went to the stream on a quiet morning, too early for the loudest of small children and just about right for a few dog walkers in activewear. The opening to the forest was comfortingly bright, and the dry branches above were unencumbered by their usual springtime canopy. 

Dead leaves and chunks of snow crunched under our feet as we climbed through the bushes toward the stream. A quick leap took us over the bumpy, frosted surface and onto a flat rock in the middle of the stream, where we sat down to face the waterfall. If it were summertime, water would have rushed over the rock and we would not have had a place to sit. It was winter, though, and it was calm.

Mandy pulled out her charcoal, and the sketching paper that real artists use, and sketched. I am not an artist, at least not like Mandy is, but I sketched too. She lent me a spare sheet and we shared her special art pencils. It was silent for a while, except for the coarse sound of graphite on paper. We sketched wearing bulky ski gloves, took them off when it got too tough to draw, then put them back on when our fingers started feeling numb.

I don’t remember whose idea it was to climb the waterfall. Probably hers. The waterfall was only a few feet tall and powerless in its suspended state. The edge of the waterfall was visible under the rows of icicles, wrapped in tree roots and garnished with stray trigs. You couldn’t see it in the summer when water flowed, but in the winter everything was still.

Careful hops brought us to the rock closest to the waterfall. Grabbing hold of the thick roots and with a quick push, we mounted the waterfall, each shattering a few rows of icicles along the way. Beyond the waterfall, rocks were scattered throughout the width of the stream. We hopped across them clumsily, without strategy. Some teetered when we stepped on them, cracking the surrounding ice and letting gelid water ooze out from underneath.

As we moved farther into the forest, the shapes changed. At some places, the rocks were sharp, and crossing was difficult. At some places, they were flat, smooth, and easy. Sometimes we had to tiptoe over tree roots, and sometimes we swung around moss-covered tree trunks. We used a piece of sketchbook paper to map everything out. 

At the end of the stream was a broad, flat rock where both of us could fit at the same time. It felt like the final destination in an adventure that someone had planned and left for us to find. On the map, we labeled it Zone Seven. That sounded cool.

## Bridge to Terabithia

We kept going back to the stream, and we discovered something new with every trip. We found tunnels and secret hiding spots, which were really just sewage drains and someone’s neglected backyard. We made new, better maps of the forest.

On the side of the stream opposite the trail, we found a clearing. The ground there was flat and hard, coated in slightly gray snow. It was old snow, but the surface was still smooth, untrodden. The top layer had melted a bit and then frozen again, so that the surface crunched when we stepped in it. The icy holes left clear evidence of our trespass. In the middle of the clearing, a massive tree trunk had fallen atop an upright tree stump, which kept it propped up. The fallen tree was enormous, as wide as two people lined up next to each other. It formed a long incline, at least ten feet off the ground at its apex. Its roots protruded from the ground, each one as thick as my arm. Mandy called it the Bridge to Terabithia, after the book her class had just read at school. Our tree bore no resemblance to the bridge from the book, but we called it that anyway. It had the same kind of magical effect.

Mandy started climbing. I followed. The damp tree bark provided a bit of friction under our feet. By halfway, I was ready to give up. The height made me dizzy. My hands were shaky. Mandy kept climbing, and I followed. We reached the top. From there, you couldn’t tell how dirty the snow was. It glistened in the sun. 

Mandy wanted to climb through the fallen tree branches and slide down the upright trunk like on a firehouse pole. I didn’t want to follow because I wasn’t brave. Mandy reached the top, and then she fell off the Bridge to Terabithia. I crawled back down the way I came. 

We went home and dried off our fuzzy socks on the heating vent, which made the whole house smell like feet. We took sips of watery Swiss Miss, took naps on the carpet, and before we knew it, it was summer again.

## Ice Bowling

One day one summer a long time ago, it rained. The air had been heavy for weeks. It clung to my skin, sticky. It made me stick to our plastic lawn chairs, to our faux-leather sofa.

That day, the rain fell down in sheets, slamming into the pavement, taking away all the heat that had soaked into the blackness and carrying it up in a slow steam. The sewers rumbled as they flushed away the weight of the week. It was the only kind of rain that I liked, the satisfying kind that came down all at once. The rest of the time, the rain was the lousy kind that felt like a swarm of gnats in my face.

We always had a bowl of ice out in the summer because my parents never bought any of the cold treats we liked to eat. That day, we took fistfuls of ice with us, two each.

We didn’t wear shoes. No socks, either. The water was already thick on the streets. Our feet smacked the ground, splashing. The coarseness of the pavement didn’t hurt. The rain had already carried away all the sandy bits, the pebbles, and the shards of green glass from the neighbor’s latest garage party.

We were alone between my row of townhouses and a row of cars parked by the curb, where my family’s silver Honda Civic awaited a free car wash.

A cube went up, and down, gracefully landed with a crack, scattered, dissolved into the pavement. One by one, ice cubes went shooting out, skipping along the glossy road, making ripples as they went.

It’s the kind of freedom you can only have when no one is watching.

It stopped raining. We went back inside, where the air conditioning had made the ceramic tiles cold like ice. Our shirts clung to our backs, dripping over the carpeted stairs as we walked.

We tried it again, once, a few years later, but it wasn’t the same. We decided the rain wasn’t right. Next time, we promised, we wouldn’t settle for mediocre rain. We kept waiting for the perfect rain to come, but it never came, and at some point, we stopped paying attention. 

## Taco Salad

Every year, at the end of summer, the community clubhouse across the street from me hosts a taco salad pool party. 

Mandy and I used to go to the community pool party every year. The party is to celebrate the last day of the pool being open, and the last day of summer before it gets too cold to swim. Truth be told, by that time summer’s long over and it’s already too cold to swim. People mostly just come for free taco salads made of tortillas and lettuce and canned beans that taste distinctly of Suburban Wholesale. No one really swims on that day, but Mandy and I always do. Swimming at the taco party every year is probably our only real tradition. To be honest, it’s not really swimming—it’s too cold to do any real swimming, and really, I’m not a good enough swimmer to do any real swimming. We just kind of wade around and shiver in the shallow end of the water. It’s symbolic. Of what, we aren’t sure. It’s tradition.

The last time I went to the pool party was in eighth grade, right before I moved away. 

That day, the sky was a soft wooly gray. It was windy, and the bare, flimsy poolside trees flapped like flags. Mandy and I were the only ones in the pool. I stood stiffly in the three-foot end, next to the opening where the filters were, and where the underwater pool lighting offered an odd warm spot. Water pushed in, and clapped back with a glub glub kind of sound. We didn’t talk much because it was cold. 

The first droplets hit the surface with soft pitter patter, and they got faster. The lifeguard made us get out then, mostly because it was raining but also because he wanted the last two people to leave so he could go home early. 

We bought a grape Fanta from the vending machine to share and sat around the edge of the pool for a while. The rain was warmer than the pool had been. 

We both caught colds when we went home that night.

After that summer party, right before I started high school, I moved two miles down the road. It wasn’t far, but I couldn’t go to the pool parties anymore. 

That year, Mandy declined her invitation to attend a special little science high school an hour from home, and I didn’t. 

On April seventh, 2018, there was a fire at the clubhouse. It made the local news. Huge orange flames on Calamint Court! Or so I heard. I can’t say for sure; I don’t live there anymore.
