Marilyn stared at the foam noodle cup on her desk. The watery soup occupying the bottom third of the cup was room-temperature now, and a cool ring of condensation had formed opposite it on the smudged glass surface of her table. Her bedroom door was shut from earlier in the afternoon, when she'd closed it to feel some sense of isolation from, well, nothing, reallyâ€”she lived alone. The distinctive stench of soy and ambiguously spicy flavoring powder had invaded the space. 

It smelled pathetic.

She looked down at herself, at the respectable pants she'd put on in place of her usual sweats, convincing herself that this act of normalcy would compensate for her having awakened past noon.

The moment of awareness shifted her attention to the bra she'd put on for the same purpose, the underwire of which was now cutting into her ribcage, creating a wavy pink imprint that she'd later examine in the mirror before a longer-than-necessary shower.

She caught a glance of her own reflection in her laptop screen, which had fallen quietly asleep in her distraction.

While not shocked by the exhausted-looking expression, she was disappointed in how little of her tiredness her countenance concealed. (At least *try*, she seemed to want to say.) Marilyn concentrated on relaxing the muscles of her face, letting her eyebrows sink into their places while trying to pinpoint at which point between being blissfully asleep and groggily awakening earlier in the day they had assumed their new positions. It seemed unlikely that they could've done so in her sleep.

A dull, sour pain had settled in behind her eyes. She raised a hand to her forehead, rubbing two fingers against the oil that had accumulated between her brows, and contemplated going back to bed. She'd only been awake a couple hours, but the late afternoon sun that leaked in beneath her drawn curtains was enough to convince her that she'd done enough for the day.
