Liz Cournoyer first encountered Buddhist meditation eighteen years ago. Her father, a meditator, had introduced the practice to her when she was just eleven. Now a longtime follower of Tibetan Buddhist teachings, she regularly attends meditation sessions at the Bodhi Path Buddhist Center in Rockville Maryland, which is just two blocks from her house. 

The Rockville center is the first of many founded by great Buddhist master Shamar Rinpoche (Shamarpa), the 14th Red Hat Lama of Tibet. The centers focus on the teachings rooted in the Kagyu lineage in Tibetan Buddhism, many of which were curated by Shamarpa after years of travel and study among Buddhist scholars.

“It’s very unusual to have a great Buddhist master like Shamar Rinpoche literally be available to me two blocks from your house in a suburb of Maryland,” Cournoyer said. “That’s not a common thing. And when you meet a great master like that, it’s not an intellectual thing; it’s not just a fun thing or interesting thing. You’re meeting someone really special. I think as soon as I met him, I was kind of connected with that center and continued to be.”

For Cournoyer, Buddhism is not a religion but a way of life, and a way of perceiving reality. Bodhi Path teachings emphasize the importance of looking at life more clearly rather than accepting the most intuitive perception of reality as one is taught to see it. Cournoyer sees this perspective as a particularly useful tool in confronting difficult situations.

“If something is difficult, many people are socialized to run away from it and go get distracted and do something else. Go be with friends. Go to the movies. Go shopping. Go do something else,” Cournoyer said. “Buddhists run right to it. Whatever the difficult thing is, Buddhism looks at difficulty as opportunity to look more deeply at how are we really feeling and what is the experience, not what we assume we feel, but to really dig in and say, ‘what is that?’”

According to Cournoyer, at the heart of Buddhist teachings is the idea that suffering is all-pervasive in human life. Rather than see it as a disheartening observation on the human condition, Cournoyer chooses to see Buddhist practices as offering hope of escaping this suffering. 

“The whole idea is, if we’re able to get to the root of [suffering], if you can look for the triggers and find the source, you can potentially become free of it. You can potentially see it with a greater view, Cournoyer said. “[For example], in [examining] the difficulty in relationships with other people, you can see more the motive of what is driving that person and with compassion, you become much more able to accept and let go of your own reaction. It’s very much a self-examination and also willingness to change. Then, by that, you become more free of the common sources of suffering.”

In the same way as she uses Buddhist teachings to overcome external challenges, Cournoyer also employs mindfulness strategies to manage her inner world. As Cournoyer says, the untrained mind is easily distracted, and frequently dwells on things outside of one’s present reality. In the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, Cournoyer seeks peace in solitary activities like gardening. At the same time, she works to train her mind to remain mindful of the present. 

“I watch my mind as I garden. Sometimes I focus on negative things. I can go off in a tangent, and then I go okay, and then I look at my mind, and I look at what is happening now, what is reality now, and then when I do that, it’s a different experience. All I’m doing is digging in the dirt and moving things from here to there, and moving plants and putting water in them. And that, in my mind, is a more real experience because that’s what I’m actually doing in that moment in time,” Cournoyer said.

For Cournoyer, meditation is key in training the mind to become more critical of how one perceives reality and avoiding becoming lost in thoughts. Cournoyer makes a key distinction between the mind and one’s thoughts, the realization of which is crucial to developing control over one’s reactions to events in one’s environment.

“Thinking is just a tool. That is not our mind; our mind is much bigger than thinking. Thinking is just a piece of the action,” Cournoyer said. “Usually, when something happens, you immediately react. But when you start to practice meditation, your mind kind of calms down, [which] helps you have a moment [before responding], so instead of reacting automatically, you’re responding accordingly.”

Cournoyer advises beginners in meditation to start by incorporating short sessions into day-to-day life, before building up to longer sessions. 

“The mind gets distracted [easily], so you want to have, in the beginning, something to focus on, and oftentimes we suggest focusing on your breath. Invariably, you’ll get distracted, and very gently you become aware and bring yourself back to the counting and the breathing. Just do that for a few moments or a few minutes at a time. The mind doesn’t like to be constrained. It needs to have a break and then you can build up over time,” Cournoyer said. 

At Bodhi Path, meditation and philosophy are equally emphasized, and in addition to brief meditation sessions, Cournoyer suggests incorporating small amounts of Buddhist philosophy into practice. She cautions against attempting to read Buddhist books all at once, and instead emphasizes a gradual reading of Buddhist literature. According to Cournoyer, Buddhist thought is most impactful when applied to daily life. 

“Good Buddhist books you don’t just read. You just don’t go, ‘okay, I’m just going to read this like a novel.’ That is not a good idea. It is [better] to read a little bit, and say ‘what is that?’ And then put it into practice and reflect on what it means. You’ll get much more out of it,” Cournoyer said. “Normal life is very good for your practice. It’s not separate. Not for a good practitioner anyway, it’s not separate at all.”
