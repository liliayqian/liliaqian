Here, I attempt to put the last year into words.

I will begin at the moment it all began to break apart. Early in January, when I had just returned from break.

My mental health was at an all-time low. Simple ruptures in the seams of my fragmented, fragile sense of stability were now viciously ripping apart. My mind was in violent turbulence. I desperately grasped for something that would relieve me of the dark, swirling pit of prickly anxiety inside of me.

The oddest part may be the physical sensations of that period. My whole body felt tender, as if bruised. To simply exist was overwhelming; I could only regain some sense of safety by enveloping myself in heavy darkness. I spent much time buried under the covers, face-down with the lights turned off.

Somehow, I stayed afloat through two months of the spring semester. I existed only at that bare-minimum level where there is hardly enough substance to distinguish one day from the next.

I must make the guilty admission that I was thankful for the arrival of the pandemic.
