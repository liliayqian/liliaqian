How does one fall in love with the craft rather than the idea of it? 

There is a truth in responding to what you naturally gravitate toward. And perhaps I have not done enough reflection on my natural tendencies. But there are questions that pop up in my mind, then: 

How can you come to trust your natural inclinations? Are there not more questions to ask of yourself? How do you know that your first response isn't simply a reflection of the heuristics most deeply and thoroughly embedded in your mind? Or even the most recent objects of your fleeting infatuation?

I think the answer that comes to mind is that you can't. I can only speak for myself here. I am forced to question my initial reaction because I cannot be sure of its source. With every pang of adrenaline or excitement that shoots through me when I consider a possibility for myself, I may wonder about its source. It seems the same physiological reaction appears with a moment of fear that I have fallen behind my peers. 

Interestingly, the question seems to tread on the question of physiological manifestations of emotion. Which comes first, the feeling or the thought? Are your thoughts simply a way to rationalize your body's instantaneous reactions? Do the body's reflexes mirror your thoughts? Is one always capable of expressing in words just what they are feeling at a given moment? (The obvious answer here is no, as I so clearly know from my personal experience.) 

To return to the original question: perhaps this is where a long period of deep thought comes into play. I feel most stagnant when I have not spoken with myself for a time. When I have not committed to semi-permanence my emotions, I am left unable to explain them. But the remaining problem is this: deep thought often leads to second-guessing one's choices, and, while questioning your beliefs is undoubtedly useful, it renders decisions of intuition far less persuasive to your future self who must live out these choices. 

I must attempt to relate the question of passion back to the mind-body issue. Perhaps the question of whether one can accurately interpret his or her emotions is similar to that of whether or not she can correctly interpret, and importantly, rationalize inclinations. Perhaps it is true that in a person's life there are natural pulls toward certain things, implying that the person attaches some subtle significance to that subject. 

When I was younger, I always found art and literature more capable of holding my interest than, say, politics or science. There must have been intrinsic meaning in there for me, that perhaps my pre-adolescent self could not understand nor articulate. I wonder now if it would be artificial of me to attempt such an analysis. Indeed, I think it unlikely. It is easy for me now to pull out abstract explanations of art's significance in the world, or why literature seems so much more dynamic and impactful than any other medium. I can just as easily explain the role of scientific discovery, space exploration, or political discussion. The problem of intuition is that it is so easily overrun by "logical" explanations of significance and meaning. As it turns out, meaning can be attributed to anything. 

It is a hard line to walk when deciding whether one is in love with the idea of an action, or the action itself. It is once again Agnes Callard's idea of Aspiration that comes to mind in addressing this. Callard describes aspiration as the acquisition of a new value set, one which has been identified as desirable but which has not been experienced or proven worthy. In other words, it is simply an infatuation with a concept without any way of truly knowing what it is like to embody those values. Somewhat ironically, it is only through upholding a slight pretense of understanding that one may test out these values and decide whether they are indeed in line with oneself.

In late May this year, I dipped my toe in a deliciously exciting new field. In a somewhat circular fashion, I was drawn to it without having tried it, and had thoroughly convinced myself that it was my calling in life before beginning to actually work in it. This was the very start of my venture into graphic design and computer programming. Through brief and admittedly extremely limited interactions with the field, I was instantly enamored. I made plans to build my career from it. I created a "goal resume" that I wanted to materialize by the year's end. The whole experience was deeply intuitive, and to a large extent, impulsive. These are things I can only say in hindsight. Even starting out I realized that having no prior exposure, I needed to seek out experiences for myself in order to truly understand the act. I had no way of knowing whether my overnight passion had sparked from a true connection with the work or with the work itself; since I had never tried the work, I could only work off an inkling that it might be the kind of thing I would like. (And perhaps that inkling is the thing that we are discussing here, in which case we could have an entirely separate conversation about what constitutes a gut feeling.) 

That said, I think that weaker forces like these are those on which one may reliably lean. Inklings, shall we say, that sway a person in one broad direction over another. Emphasis on broad. Narrower alleyways of passion, career, and direction must not be left up to intuition. 

Try the things that intuition pulls you toward.
