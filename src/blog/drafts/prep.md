It's hard to think of a book that had stronger influence on my early development than Prep. 

As I look back on it now, I wonder if I might have read it too early in my childhood. I wonder about the subtle (and maybe not-so-subtle) influences that it had on my worldview at the time. 

Prep is this very psychologically acute portrait of anxiety, depression, the cynicism that arises from an extremely warped worldview. The way Lee overanalyzes every single interaction she has with other people, how consciously she measures social hierarchies, and how deeply pessimistic she is about her status in the worldâ€”it's a painful portrait of the anxious mind, and one too familiar to me.
