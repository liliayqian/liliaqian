There were primary-colored swirls painted all over the circular ceiling as I laid awake between two other girls. I felt the way I imagined a newborn child might feel, laid to rest on its back in an unfamiliar nursery, curiously entertained by the arbitrary objects dangling over its head. 
 
My trip to Inner Mongolia in the summer of 2019 was part of a venture by the government of the People’s Republic of China—to expose the Chinese-American youth to their roots, their culture, their history. I had reached the maximum qualifying age for these trips, eighteen that year, and it would be my first and only CCP-sponsored trip to what was supposed to be the Motherland.
 
And so, I ended up laying in a desert yurt, waiting for the next morning when I would don my yellow camp shirt and pile onto a tour bus packed with mostly pre-teens and heavily chaperoned by twenty-something volunteers closer in age to me than the peers with whom I traveled. Though I was nearly eighteen, I looked more like a girl of thirteen, which is really to say that on this trip, I was, for all intents and purposes, a child. 
 
I cannot describe how bizarre I felt when my twenty-two-year-old chaperone—a real adult—offered me and my twelve-year-old companions some popsicles as a treat for being “good” at the museum. I wondered what to say. 
 
...Thanks? 
 
I had been snatched from the comforts of quasi-adulthood I enjoyed back home (at that point, I was a freshly-licensed high school graduate who had somewhat deluded myself into believing that my legal ability to purchase cigarettes somehow signified a new chapter of maturity and adulthood.) 
 
I felt, for the first time, completely alienated in my surroundings. The camaraderie of the “Chinese American” experience we were supposed to enjoy on this trip felt wholly artificial; after all, what was the experience I was meant to share? I found it bizarre that this was a trip designed for us to bond over shared heritage, but I saw nothing in common with them. Those kids who were badgering our chaperones to pretty please take us to the mall and not another museum? I rejected the association altogether. 
 
At some point I found myself seated on a little trolley cart moving comically slowly across the Inner Mongolian plains. Next to me, a boy I’d never met—he wasn’t part of my tour bus, and I had certainly not made no effort to meet anyone else in my time there.
 
He introduced himself as a sixth grader from Cadiz, Spain. As the trolley cart squeaked and struggled over the arid terrain, he chattered easily on about his favorite animes and video games, the neighborhood in Spain where he had grown up. He spoke so easily, and with none of my own self-conscious neuroses, that for the first time that I could remember that trip, I forgot about how out of place I felt, forgot to resent my childlike appearance and forgot the snobbish cynicism that I had carried with me from home. It was...fun. 
 
Suddenly, my efforts to distance myself from immaturity felt petty, immature in itself. I began to wonder why I was so attached to proving that I was an adult. 
 
The question was, who even cared? Clearly this kid didn’t care whether I was his age or his parents’ age. 
 
Those things that I had deemed immutable parts of my identity—my age, my race, my parents’ culture—were so easily swept aside. This was quite possibly the first time I truly existed, alone in the world, untethered to anything I could claim for my identity. I was suspended from the reality that I knew to be my truth, jammed in a strange space between my own nebulous ideas of childhood and adulthood.
