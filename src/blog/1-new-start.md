Every time I tell someone I'm taking a year off from school, they inevitably ask: "so what are you doing instead?" I have no answer to this question. I could choose to tell them about how this period of extended nothingness has sparked intense emotional growth and generated greater mental stability than I've had in years -- and this is all very true, but honestly, it's just too much work to say all that, and I have half a mind that believes no one really wants to hear about it. Because really, what I'm "doing" is sitting around at home spending most of my time in my own head, and while I myself have no qualms about spending my time in this way, this is far less convenient and glamorous an answer than, say, an internship.

So here is the question that has me spinning my wheels in the mud: is there something I'm supposed to be doing? 

There are two competing lines of thought in my head when it comes to this question. Philosophically speaking, my answer is a definitive no. I am of the belief that purpose is a myth -- I exist for no specific reason, and by extension, my existence will be of no ultimate significance. If I could indulge in living my life fully in line with my views on existence, I would probably be doing just what I am now: being content with simply being allowed to exist. 

The problem is, I live my life with existential views tucked in my back pocket, and practical realities constantly and relentlessly smacking me in the face. I recognize the level of privilege I have in being able to put off my college education a year in order to sit around and contemplate purpose, and the meaning of life, and all those other bits of neurotic garbage. Truth be told, I feel positively guilty for enjoying this period of stagnation and passivity when I could be, say, *doing things*.

I suppose the most pragmatic answer I can think of to the question of whether I need to be doing things is this: "no, there's nothing you're 'supposed' to be doing, but there are tons of things that you could do that would be significantly to your benefit." 

Those things being: 
- Advancing my ~career~
- Doing things that one could put on a resume. But not in a resume-packy kind of way. You know what I mean.

Yes, yes, all very good, very practical things. So: why am I so resistant to the idea?

For one thing, it's awfully paralyzing to realize that your primary interests involve engaging in philosophical debate with, ehem, yourself. So far, I haven't found that to be the most lucrative of career pursuits. 

For another, I find it exceptionally difficult to choose a single thing to pursue. Blame my limited attention span, or my indecisive nature. Or the fact that I really don't believe that I have a singular purpose to fulfill and so as a result I feel like I'm making a choice simply to exist within a societal framework on a superficial level. But then the decision itself feels insincere, and then whatever I choose is never really going to earn my full and undivided attention, now is it?

... I'll leave that line of thought where it is for now.

Getting back to the point: I'm doing nothing. To be fair, I don't truly believe that it's *nothing*--I'm doing lots of things. It's just that none of the things properly belong on a resume, and from that perspective, it's very much *nothing*.

So here's where this, uh, blog comes into the picture. I'm setting aside my visceral fear of putting my personal thoughts and feelings out into a world in a place where they might be traced back to me. (Silly past me paid for this domain for a year up front thinking I would use it for a portfolio in becoming a designer. What do you know? I no longer want to become a designer.) 

This is a challenge to myself to document my life. Maybe a little so that I feel like I'll have something to show for myself at the end of this crazy year. Perhaps just to get over the inevitable tragedy that I'll wind up forgetting most of my life by the end of it. (just keep a diary, you lunatic)
