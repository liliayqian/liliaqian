Lately, the words climate crisis seem to be on everyone's mind. Sustainability. Corporate responsibility.

In keeping with this, I myself have become increasingly conscious of my own environmental footprint. I bring my own bags for groceries. I sort my recyclables. Limit my meat and dairy consumption. You know, little things. The difference it makes is probably marginal at best, but it is what it is.

Until recently, I never thought too hard about why I imposed these habits on myself. I suppose it was a combination of passive adjustments to match pace with those around me and a vague notion of ethical responsibility.

While speaking with a friend a while back, I was asked this:

If you don't think there's anything after death, why do you care about the environment?

A bit of context is required to break down why exactly this question felt so significant.

First is a feature of my personal worldview. As someone who did not grow up religious, I am of the belief that one simply ceases to exist after death. If this is the case, then the idea that your life should have some enduring impact on the world is of relatively little consequence—after all, you no longer exist to witness the effects of your actions (or inactions, I suppose). As I go through the motions of my life I pay no heed to the potential karmic consequences of my mistakes—I've never felt the need to.

Of course, to apply this to environmentalism in particular assumes that I will not experience the brunt of climate disasters within my lifetime. (Some would argue against this, and to be fair, I'm not particularly certain about this point either, given recent developments in climate change.) For the sake of this thought process, though, I will maintain this assumption.

Another assumption is that my current well-being is not tied to the well-being of a person in my future—a biological child, for instance. This is a common argument for environmental responsibility: even if you do not anticipate feeling the most disastrous effects of climate change in this lifetime, we owe it to future generations to maintain a healthy environment. This is quite valid, but for argument's sake let's say that I have little attachment to the future generation and have no plans to have children of my own. (The environmentally-conscious choice would be to forgo procreation, no?)

The logical problem that remains, however, is that despite the fact that I both believe in and hope for an infinite nothingness after my death, I still feel a strong sense of ethical responsibility when it comes to many facets of my life. 

I imagine should be relieved about this—my worldview gives me little incentive to behave in what we might consider a "moral" way, but there is some urgency in my mind still to be kind, fair, or environmentally-conscious the result of which is that I have not become a criminal of some sort.

Relief aside, there is still a little bit of mental work to be done to resolve the logical conflict.

To be honest, the conclusion I have come to at the moment is quite simple, and admittedly somewhat of a cop-out.

Hear me out:

Given that I think my existence is limited to the time that I am alive on Earth, all incentive for anything I do must also come from things existing alongside me. 

My incentive to be (or try to be) kind is twofold: from a purely self-serving perspective, an act of altruism in a close-knit, collaborative society is likely to return to improve either my mental or physical well-being down the line. In addition, society has decided altruism to be a virtue—something you can feel good about. It is of immediate benefit to me to do something that makes me feel good. 

In the case of environmental responsibility, the same applies: yes, I feel somewhat of an urgency to behave in a way that is environmentally sustainable to the extent that I can. If I must summon an explicit reason, the one most in line with my worldview would be that this behavior has immediate incentives both for functioning in society and in the comfort of my experience in the world.

In other words, if I were to take the most cyncial view possible on morality, I would eventually settle on the idea that I perceive there to be some intangible benefit from behaving in a way that society currently deems virtuous.
