I have a folder full of half-to-mostly-written blog posts hanging around, unpublished either because I lack the drive to finish them or because perfectionist impulses convince me that they are not good enough to meet the public eye. 

Gone with perfectionism! Here are some thoughts, unedited, mostly for my own future reflection.

From my observation, it seems like empathy is often championed over sympathy, as if an empathetic human demonstrates some stronger level of emotional understanding than someone who is merely sympathetic. 

(Here, I use the loose definitions of sympathy as understanding another's feelings while empathy is experiencing those feelings, involving some level of projection based on what you think you understand about that person.)

I will admit that, for a long time, I have largely bought into this statement. I thought that any fool could express sympathy: "sorry about that," "cheer up" but that a *real* friend could, based on their elevated understanding and by extension stronger relationship with you, empathize.

But recently I've begun to realize that this notion is seriously misguided. A conversation I had with a friend a while ago brought this up in my mind: 

__It is better to offer measured sympathy than to botch empathy.__

Let me explain how I arrived at this conclusion. 

(Oh how I hate to quote myself, but to recall this conversation with utmost efficiency... These are real quotes, by the way.)

I began: "Lately I’ve been feeling bad about putting emotional burden on others. Like for deeply empathic people it’s addictive to talk to them because they get it. But then that also translates to being a burden for them along with their own problems and lives."

Without realizing it, I had made the assumption that upon hearing my worries and complaints, my friends would be inclined to empathize, and, because they are good friends, worry on my behalf about things that did not concern them. Because of course, this was what empathy *was*, right? 

This is what my friend said in response:

"I like when people put emotional burden cause I can relate."

Quick and easy. I didn't realize it at the time, but this stuck with me for weeks afterward.

I won't get into the absurd amount of overthinking that ensued, but here were the takeaways:

1. You're not *supposed* to take other people's concerns as your own. Even if there are special exceptions, this can't be the rule or we'd go crazy very quickly.
2. Vulnerability is the crux of intimacy. Growing to understand someone is made possible only when both parties are open to the possibility of revealing information about themselves. Simply not revealing your vulnerable moments in order to spare your friends of emotional burden is not doing anyone a favor.
3. People need reference points to gauge their position on the emotional spectrum. What I mean by this is that we like to know that others share our feelings. It helps us judge what the "normal" (read: common) range of responses are to certain situations and makes us feel less alone in our minds. (Using others as reference points for your own experience gets a bad rep, but what we neglect is that it's so necessary to forming our expectations for emotional function within a society.)
4. The most crucial part: I thought about my expectations when confiding my troubles in other people and realized that I've never gone into a conversation hoping that someone would end up sharing my feelings by the end of it. Rather, I've only ever expected that someone would lend an ear in a moment of crisis. Talking to another person is my way of initiating a negative feedback loop of sorts; by having someone else absorb and reinforce my feelings about a situation, I temper my reactions and avoid spiraling into a puddle of anxious overthinking.


These beliefs were reinforced recently in a conversation with a different friend. I was complaining about some mundane issue or another, and my friend responded with customary condolences—you know, the "that sucks," "sorry to hear," "you can do it" trio. All fine, all good. 

The part that made me freeze for a moment was when they capped it off with: "I'm sorry I'm not on your wavelength right now." 

Kneejerk reaction: Shoot, shouldn't have complained.
Secondary reaction: I never asked you to be on my wavelength.

Not in an angry way, of course—it's just that the moment really put into perspective what someone going through a tough spot (of any magnitude) expects when they share their troubles. Definitive answer: not "empathy," especially not as we understand it today.

I'll end this with a note on how our definitions of empathy might have changed over time, and how looking to the origins of the concept might be a powerful centering force for readjusting our expectations for empathy.

A light amount of Googling took me to an early definition of empathy. In the days before empathy was widely known, *Reader's Digest* described empathy as the “ability to appreciate the other person’s feelings **without yourself becoming so emotionally involved that your judgment is affected**.”

Compare that with definition that comes up today from searching the word empathy: "the ability to understand and share the feelings of another."

Our modern definition of empathy, while far catchier and nicer for popular consumption, lacks the necessary nuance to convey all that is necessary in being empathetic. Interestingly, the earlier definition reminds me more of our modern understanding of sympathy—it still involves the emotional labor of understanding another person's situation and concerns, but emphasizes the necessary distance to mentally separate someone else's problems from your own.

I find this especially important in an age when emotional stability is increasingly difficult to maintain as the digitization of social life creates a one-directional flow of information. It's easier than ever to become emotionally entrenched in issues that don't necessarily pertain to you, and for your own thoughts to be contaminated with those of others. That's why I think it's so important that people don't default to thinking that they *should* empathize. If we are to provide the people around us with the support they need, it is crucial that every individual has a clear idea of where they draw their emotional boundaries can maintain the appropriate balance of understanding and distance.
